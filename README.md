# React Formik Login Form

## Description
This project is a simple React application that demonstrates how to create a login form with validation using the Formik library. The login form includes fields for email and password, and it provides validation messages to ensure that the email is in the correct format and that both fields are filled out before submission. If the validation passes, a success message is displayed.

## How to Run
1. Clone the repository: `git clone https://github.com/LucaBrizuela/BuildAFormikForm/tree/main`
2. Install the dependencies: `npm install`
3. Start the application: `npm start`
4. Open the application in your browser: The application will automatically open in your default web browser at `http://localhost:3000`.

## Roadmap
- Add functionality to remember user login.
- Enhance the form with additional fields such as "Remember Me" checkbox.
- Implement password visibility toggle.
- Style the form with more modern and responsive design.
